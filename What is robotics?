What I learned in light bot was how to program a robot to do what you wanted it to do and also you learn what each function 
does and makes it easy for me to make it do things because I know what each function does,at first I was confused of what 
each function did until I tried them all and relize what it did. Light Bot was pretty fun to use and to play around and 
see what every button did.
